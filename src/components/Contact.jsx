              <h2>On-site Security</h2>
              <p>Our onsite security company, ADT Security Services, conducts random nightly patrols of our common areas and facilities only. To contact ADT, residents may call (800) 716-3640. When calling, state that you are calling for an “alarm response”.</p>
              <p><b>As a reminder, please know that HBHOA residents are highly encouraged to call the police if wanting to report suspicious activity anywhere on site.</b> The police are equipped to remove trespassers from HBHOA property, and will likely be able to respond more quickly to a serious concern. Residents should call security to report concerns that are not serious or time-sensitive in nature. Please note that this security vendor, much like the previous vendor, may only respond to owner calls during the nighttime and early morning patrol hours.</p>
